**Voiceover (your voice, calm and reflective):**

> This... is what we usually imagine when we think of a black hole.
> A place where space bends, light curves, and time itself gets strange.

*(As the 3D grid warps and the black hole sphere fades in, the camera slowly rotates)*

> And normally, to make sense of this — you’d need Einstein’s general relativity.
> You’d need the full machinery: spacetime tensors, differential geometry, and many other tools physcists use to understand black holes.

*(Beat. The animation continues slowly turning. Silence for a second.)*

> But what if I told you...
> That you can actually estimate one of the most profound properties of a black hole — its **entropy** — using just **high school physics**?

---

**Voiceover:**

> I want to walk you through a thought experiment. One that helped me feel — really *feel* — the physics behind black holes, in a way that equations never quite did.

> Let’s start simple.

*(Scene fades to white or paper texture. Clean title appears.)*

**“You Don’t Need General Relativity to Understand Black Holes”**


📚 **\[Part 1 – Setting up the question]**

**You (voiceover):**

> We want to understand how much information — or entropy — is hidden inside a black hole.
> The final formula, discovered by Hawking and Bekenstein, is:
>
> $$ S = \frac{k A c^3}{4 \hbar G} $$


> But what if you had never heard of this equation — and you just wanted to guess the entropy using dimensional analysis?

---

🧠 **\[Part 2 – What is entropy?]**

**You (explaining):**

> Let’s start with something simple: entropy. In physics, we often say:
>
> $$ S = k N $$



> where $S$ is entropy, $k$ is Boltzmann’s constant, and $N$ is the number of microstates — or really, the number of fundamental bits of information inside the system.

> So our goal is to estimate $N$, the number of bits that can fit inside a black hole.

---

🧪 **\[Part 3 – What units do we care about?]**

**You (voiceover):**

> Let’s figure out how many “bits” can fit into a black hole just by playing with **units** — using the constants:
>
> * $G$: Newton’s gravitational constant
> * $\hbar$: Planck’s constant
> * $c$: speed of light

> These are the three pillars of modern physics: **gravity, quantum mechanics, and relativity**.

---

🧲 **\[Part 4 – Finding the dimensions]**

> First, let’s recall the units of each constant:

* From **Newton’s law**:

$$
F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \Rightarrow [G] = \frac{\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2}{\text{kg}^2}
$$

* From **F = ma**:

$$
[F] = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}^2
\Rightarrow [G] = \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^2}
$$

* Planck’s constant $\hbar$:

$$
[\hbar] = \text{J} \cdot \text{s} = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 / \text{s}
$$

* Speed of light $c$:

$$
[c] = \text{m/s}
$$

---

🧮 **\[Part 5 – Build something with dimensions of area]**

**You (voiceover or writing on whiteboard):**

> We want to build a quantity with units of **area**, because black hole entropy turns out to be proportional to the **surface area** of the event horizon, not its volume.

> Let’s find a combination of $G$, $\hbar$, and $c$ that has units of area.

---

🧮 **\[Part 6 – Dimensional analysis to find the area]**

> We want to find:

$$
[G]^a [\hbar]^b [c]^c = \text{m}^2
$$

Break down the units:

* $[G] = \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$
* $[\hbar] = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$
* $[c] = \text{m/s}$

So we combine them:

$$
(\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2})^a 
\cdot 
(\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-1})^b 
\cdot 
(\text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-1})^c 
= \text{m}^2
$$

Solve for $a, b, c$ such that:

* powers of m: $3a + 2b + c = 2$
* powers of kg: $-a + b = 0$
* powers of s: $-2a - b - c = 0$

Solve the system:

From $-a + b = 0 \Rightarrow b = a$
From $-2a - b - c = 0 \Rightarrow -3a - c = 0 \Rightarrow c = -3a$
Sub into first:
$3a + 2a -3a = 2 \Rightarrow 2a = 2 \Rightarrow a = 1$

So:

$$
a = 1, \quad b = 1, \quad c = -3
$$

That gives us:

$$
A \sim \frac{G \hbar}{c^3}
$$

---

🔚 **\[Part 7 – Put it all together]**

> If the number of bits is proportional to the surface area of the black hole, then:

$$
N \sim \frac{A}{G \hbar / c^3}
$$

> And entropy becomes:

$$
S \sim k \cdot N \sim k \cdot \frac{A c^3}{G \hbar}
$$

Which is *almost* the real answer — up to a factor of 4:

$$
S = \frac{k A c^3}{4 G \hbar}
$$

📌 **\[Closing Thoughts – direct to camera]**

**You (calm, reflective):**

> So you don’t need general relativity.
> You don’t even need quantum gravity.

> Just dimensional analysis — and curiosity.

> To me, that’s what makes physics so beautiful.
